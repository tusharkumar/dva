Dominant Variance Analysis
--------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION
Dominant Variance Analysis (DVA) is a new profile analysis technique that extracts
out the common/recurrent/dominant patterns of behavior of an application.
It is pertinent to applications with complex control-flow behavior that
is fairly sensitive to the data-set. DVA summarizes the dynamic call-graph behavior
of a large, complex application in just a handful of patterns.

DVA makes the following types of application characterizations easy:
 a) Reveal parts of application behavior that are sensitive to variations in data

 b) Determine what parts of an interactive/streaming application are susceptible to
    jitter, or may be relevant for defining the soft-real-time execution properties of
    the application.

 c) See the principal data-set independent structure of the application.
    Often such a structure closely resembles the high-level or functional
    design of the application. Large number of functions are omitted if they
    are determined irrelevant with regards to influencing behavior. The final
    results are represented as simple structures involving just a few functions,
    where the behavior of the same function is differentiated based on its
    differing behavior under differing call-contexts.

 d) See data-set specific variations of behavior.

Please refer to [1] for the main concepts underlying DVA and a description of the
VCG representation used by DVA to present the results.

3. BUILDING
 - The analysis is written in python, and does not need to be compiled.

 - However, the application needs to be profile-instrumented by a compiler
   in order to produce profile events that the DVA can analyze.

 - There are multiple ways in which the profile-instrumentation can be done,
   as explored in [2]. In this distribution, we provide one method for
   convenience, in the form of an LLVM compiler pass for C/C++ applications.

  STEPS for building Profile-Instrumentation:
   a) First install the LLVM compiler infrastructure. This can be
      done in a local user directory.

        http://llvm.org

    TODO: Update with instructions for recent LLVM versions.

   b) Let LLVM_SRC_DIR represent the directory containing the LLVM
       source code.
      Copy the dva/prof_instr/DVA_ProfileInstrument directory to
         LLVM_SRC_DIR/lib/Transform.

   c) Under LLVM_SRC_DIR/lib/Transform/DVA_ProfileInstrument:
       type 'make' to build the profile-instrumentation pass.

    NOTE: PATH should include the 'bin' directories for both
          the LLVM install-directory, and the llvm-gcc directory.
          LLVM installation instructions cover this.
     

4. Applying Dominant Variance Analysis to Applications
  - The Makefile of an application must be modified to use
     llvm-gcc instead of gcc, and to apply the profile-instrumentation.

   For a simple illustration of compiling using llvm-gcc, see

      http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/docs/GettingStarted.html#tutorial

  - Please refer to dva/samples/README_samples for an illustration
     of applying DVA to the mpeg2dec and mpeg2enc applications from
     the MediaBench II video suite.

5. Profiling multi-threaded applications
  - DVA is currently limited to profiling a single thread of the application.
    The user must explicitly identify a thread to profile before enabling profile dumping.
    (Note: explicit identification is not required if the application is not multi-threaded).

  - Recommended steps:
     + Add the following declarations to the application code.

		#include <pthread.h>
		void PROFILE_select_threadid(pid_t threadid);
		void PROFILE_dump_setting(int true_of_false);

	+ At the beginining of main() disable all profiling.

		PROFILE_dump_setting(0);

	+ When the thread to be profiled has been created, determine its
	  threadid and pass to the profiler.

		PROFILE_select_threadid(my_threadid);

		NOTE: The threadid can be determined from either the thread-handle
              or from inside the selected thread as follows.

				pid_t my_threadid = syscall(SYS_gettid);

	+ Enable profiling from inside the top-level thread-function
	  in the thread with threadid = my_threadid. After this step
	  do not attempt to change the selected threadid.

		PROFILE_dump_setting(1);
